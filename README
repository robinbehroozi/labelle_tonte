This is the repository for a mock up of a site that I have online at www.labelletonte.com. It was made for a dog and cat grooming business, called Labelle Tonte. The website is in French. Anyway, I turned the site into a Wordpress theme, but here, I have the HTML 5, CSS 3 and javascript files that I used to make the site. I used the Bootstrap framework to develop it. Thanks.
